- For emissions module integrate the following files
    Coulomb interactions: Simplified diagonal matrices. Use the coulomb module for realistic calculations.
    Carrier evolution: Distributions are static. Full simulations require coupling with the SBE solver.
    Material parameters: Bulk GaAs values. Confined systems may need adjusted parameters.
    Temperature: Module-level temperature is set directly for demonstration. In production, initialize with the correct temperature.
