These examples demonstrate the capabilities of PulseSuite, a Python port of
Fortran semiconductor Bloch equation simulation tools by Gulley & Huang.

Start with the **Quickstart** to run your first simulation, then explore
the **Architecture** overview to understand how the modules fit together.
The deep-dive examples show the physics computed by each subsystem.
